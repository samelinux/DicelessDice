This is basically a booklet filled with dice rolls organized to minimize picking the next value but still having a way to "randomize" your next roll.

Dice rolls are not random. The whole process start from 12 tables filled with 6x6 unique numbers (11,12,13....44,45,46....65,66) and then jumble them around trying to create a sequence long enought to seem random.

This is not meant to be a good surce of random numbers, but to be reusable (since you can start from different positions), have a decent period and ... be "easy" to use while not being just a big table of numbers.

You can print a new version each time you need a new one here: https://samelinux.github.io/DicelessDice/DicelessDice.html
